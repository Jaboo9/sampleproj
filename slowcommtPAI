GitHub's API has several layers of limits. For Search API there's the main rate limit of 30 code searches per minute, but there's also an anti-abuse rate limit which prevents lots of expensive requests from being made in a short period of time.

Code searches are in general very expensive to compute. They normally happen when you start making concurrent requests.

Our general recommendation is to spread out your requests even more to avoid hitting limits, and if you do hit them -- you'll need to sleep for the number of seconds
